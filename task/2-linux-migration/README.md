Task — Linux Migration (Completed)
==================================

🛠 Setup Overview
-----------------

*   **Distribution:** Linux Mint 22 (Cinnamon Edition)
    
*   **Installation Method:** Dual Boot (alongside Windows)
    
*   **Status:** System fully configured and verified.
    

🚀 Migration Journey
--------------------

### 1\. Installation Decisions

I chose **Linux Mint** for its reliability and the "Cinnamon" desktop environment, which provides a familiar yet highly customizable workflow. Opting for **Dual Boot** ensures I have zero-latency access to my hardware, which is critical for my work with **IoT and Embedded Systems**.

### 2\. Configuration Steps

After the initial installation, I performed the following environment setups:

*   **System Update:** Refreshed the APT cache and upgraded all pre-installed packages.
    
*   **Development Tools:** Installed essential build tools including git, and python3.
    
*   **Environment Tweaks:** Configured the terminal and shell to better suit a full-stack development workflow.
    

### 3\. Verification

To confirm the kernel and system environment are running correctly, I utilized system information tools to verify the hardware recognition and OS layer.
