Algorithm Tour:Binary Search

I implemented a binary search algorithm in python.This algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

The algorithm assumes that the list is already sorted.

To verify the code, I ran the script with a sample list and a target value.
The expected value is the index of the target.
